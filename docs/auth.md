# .Net Core and basics of authentication

My primary focus is frontend apps. Although I used to be a .Net developer. And I always loved how fast and convenient EF Code First is on a product prototype phase. For one of my pet project I decided to build backend server with the latest (May 2017) versions of .Net Core, EF Core and Postgres database. I had deleted Visual Studio and has used Visual Studion Code. Which is a whole different tool. As you may guess things that are essentian in VS just do not exist in other IDEs (even if authored by Microsoft).


In this article I will explain how to add authentication to .Net Core project. I will not explain here how to create a .Net Core Web API application and connectit with a database. If you are interested read the previous article [.Net Core, Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL]("/"). At end of the lession we will have a tiny web API application that can handle user authorization and have protect actions.
