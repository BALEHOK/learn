# .Net and unusual environment

My primary focus is frontend apps. Although I used to be a .Net developer. And I always loved how fast and convenient EF Code First is on a product prototype phase. For one of my pet project I decided to build backend server with the latest (May 2017) versions of .Net Core, EF Core and Postgres database. I had deleted Visual Studio and has used Visual Studion Code. Which is a whole different tool by the way. As you may guess things that are essentian in VS just do not exist in other IDEs (even if authored by Microsoft).


In this series of articles I will show how you can set up a .Net Core solution with Postresql database running on any platform (Windows, Linux or Mac), I'll touch authentification and authorization, and will create a simple client with React that can consume protected API resources.


1. [.Net Core, Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL](./ef)
1. [.Net Core and basics of authentication. Part I](./auth)
1. .Net Core and basics of authentication. Part II
1. React client
1. .Net Core and Identity Server

That is all for now. Happy coding!
